Happy cooking social-network was designed by Marcia Elisabete Dos Santos as a part of her projects within the UX Experience master's degree on Kingston University, 
London, UK. She created all the layers of this no-real social-media with Figma. Happy cooking is a meal recipes-sharing social-network. 

As part of my studies to become a Software developer, I decided to make Happy Cooking project real in order to improve my practical experience. My final idea is to develop the full project with REACT NATIVE. 

However, I decided to squeeze this beautiful design using other tecnologies (less suitable) just to test my knowledge, and also, as part of my skills process improvement.

That said, I am aware that any website in order to have a responsive design first needs a "mobile approach", so following this premise, my first approach was made using only HTML and CSS, and with max-width property of 414px. The development was made doing the "bottom-up approach" (making isolated components first) and then join them by sections, following the Block Element Modifier(BEM) naming CSS classes convention [last update: 29/04/2021].

I used some external components such as:

  Icons from https://fontawesome.com/ 
  Fonts from https://fonts.google.com/
  

//Probably during summer 2021//

The next levels it will be adding more layers and functionality with JAVASCRIPT. 
On the last part, I will make the project from the scratch using REACT & REACT NATIVE.
